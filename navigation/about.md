I am Weston Gardner. I have learned the basics of a couple of languages like Python, C++, C# and java. Now I am taking the AP CSP class offered at my school, Del Norte High School, to be able to learn the basics of htlm, css, javascript, and how to work with github.

I also build and fly fpv drones as a hobbie. Throughout my expierences with that hobby I have learned how to build, solder, and electrically set up a piece of hardware, then set it up software-wise. It is always amazing to fly a drone that I build and know that that is my work up there.
