        <p class="main-body">Throughout this process, I got many errors, problems, and even a catastrophic failure!!! My main problem was that I was doing things in the incorrect order or just simply incorrectly, some commands I was running before I was running others. I had to slowly figure out my way through the setup page to figure out what I needed to do. After multiple restarts, countless sessions, and mental breakdowns, I finally completed my setup of my developing environment.</p>
