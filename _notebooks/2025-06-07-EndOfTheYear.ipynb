    "    <p>In June 2025, I was able to display my project, Poway Auto, during Night at the Museum — an annual event where students present their major projects from the year. The exhibition brought together families, educators, classmates, and community members to explore student work. It was a great opportunity for me to introduce the smart mobility platform I had been working on, describe its features, and receive feedback from a wide range of attendees.</p>\n",
    "    <hr>\n",
    "    <h2 id=\"setting-up\">Preparation</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Our team arrived ahead of time to set up our area. Rather than using posters or tri-fold boards, we connected a laptop running Poway Auto to a larger monitor so visitors could easily see the live demo. This setup allowed us to walk people through the platform as they stopped by.</p>\n",
    "    <p>We skipped printed flyers and instead generated a QR code that linked directly to our vCard, which included our names, emails, GitHub accounts, and project resources. Anyone interested could scan the code and save our contact details instantly.</p>\n",
    "    <p>The atmosphere was relaxed but organized. Guests moved around the room, stopping at displays that caught their attention. The live map and route visualization on Poway Auto’s interface drew people in and sparked questions.</p>\n",
    "    <hr>\n",
    "    <h2 id=\"how-we-presented-the-project\">Presenting the Project</h2>\n",
    "    <p>When someone approached, we introduced ourselves and described the project in straightforward language, explaining that Poway Auto is a routing tool designed for Poway, helping users find the best routes using current traffic data, local reports, and daily schedules.</p>\n",
    "    <p>We then demonstrated the system in real time. Using the interface, we showed how to:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>Input a starting location and destination</li>\n",
    "        <li>View up-to-date, traffic-aware routes using Google Maps API</li>\n",
    "        <li>Report incidents like accidents or roadwork on the map</li>\n",
    "        <li>Save preferred locations and routines for quick access</li>\n",
    "        <li>See predictions for traffic changes throughout the day</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <p>For those interested in technical details, we explained the backend — including our Flask API, SQLite database, frontend built with Leaflet, and basic predictive features using Poway-specific information.</p>\n",
    "    <p>The live demonstration ran smoothly, letting visitors see the platform update in real time and interact with features like hazard reporting and saving favorite places.</p>\n",
    "    <hr>\n",
    "    <h2 id=\"audience-interaction-and-feedback\">Audience Interaction and Feedback</h2>\n",
    "    <p>The event attracted a variety of visitors, each providing different perspectives:</p>\n",
    "    <h3 id=\"students\">Students</h3>\n",
    "    <p>Many students enjoyed experimenting with the interactive map and simulating traffic scenarios. They asked about the technologies we used and were curious about both the frontend and backend aspects.</p>\n",
    "    <h3 id=\"parents\">Parents</h3>\n",
    "    <p>Parents appreciated the idea of a tool that could simplify commuting in Poway. They offered suggestions for making the interface even more user-friendly and proposed features like scheduled notifications.</p>\n",
    "    <h3 id=\"teachers-and-mentors\">Teachers and Mentors</h3>\n",
    "    <p>Teachers and staff focused on the development process and learning outcomes. They asked about the project timeline, challenges we faced, and how we collaborated as a team. Some recommended exploring options for long-term deployment, such as creating a mobile app.</p>\n",
    "    <hr>\n",
    "    <h2 id=\"what-i-learned\">Takeaways</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Presenting Poway Auto at Night at the Museum helped me grow in several ways, both as a developer and as a communicator. Here are some things I learned from the experience:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",

    "            <p>Adapting explanations for different audiences<br>\n",
    "                I learned to adjust my descriptions based on who I was speaking with, making technical concepts accessible without oversimplifying.</p>\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "        <li>\n",
    "            <p>Observing user interaction<br>\n",
    "                Watching people use the platform highlighted which features were intuitive and which needed clarification. Some visitors needed guidance to find certain functions, pointing out areas for UI improvement.</p>\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "        <li>\n",
    "            <p>Receiving valuable suggestions<br>\n",
    "                Feedback from outside our classroom introduced new ideas, such as integrating weather data or adding route comparison tools. These suggestions could shape future updates.</p>\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "        <li>\n",
    "            <p>Collaborating on presentations<br>\n",
    "                Since Poway Auto was a group effort, presenting together helped us practice dividing responsibilities and ensuring everyone could discuss all parts of the project.</p>\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <hr>\n",
    "    <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Summary</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Night at the Museum provided a chance to share our work with a real audience, test the system in a live setting, practice public speaking, and gather actionable feedback. I left the event with a better understanding of how to communicate technical ideas, observe user behavior, and consider future improvements. Most importantly, it was rewarding to see people engage with something I helped create, not just as a school project, but as a tool with real-world potential.</p>\n",
